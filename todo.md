Progression Ideas
=================

Collect crystals, return to ship.  Use crystals to purchase upgrades.

 * Solar Panel - Charge your suit on the surface.
 * Converter - Charge your suit from crystals.
 * Laser Gun - Suit-powered pistol
 * Energy Shield - Suit-powered defense
 * Repair Suit - Heal damage sustained
 * Faster Transport - Reduced transport time
 * Suit Battery - More room for activities
 * Power Drill - Use suit's power to drill dirt

Use crystals to refill ship reserves, allowing you to travel to other
planets.

Planet difficult is determined by the number of crystals you had collected so
far when it is generated.
